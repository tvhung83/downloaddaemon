As of version 0.8, DownloadDaemon supports JDownloaders reconnect script.
A guide on how to write one can be found here: http://jdownloader.org/knowledge/wiki/reconnect/live-header-script
(If you have JD installed, you may also use it to record and create a new script).
When done, send it to me ;-)
In order to use it, put the script in /usr/[local/]share/downloaddaemon/reconnect.
No DD-restart required.
