 If this is set to true, ddclient-php will check for the file-status of each file in the download
 list when updating. This can take a long time. Generally, you should only set this to true if your server
 runs on fast hardware or you usually only use small download lists (up to ~50 downloads at once).
 If you have larger lists, the server will be overloaded pretty fast.
 The advantage of setting this to true, however, is, that you will only get the "delete file" button
 on the manage-site if there really is a file to delete. If you set it to false, the "delete file" button
 will always show up, and file-deletion will simply fail if you press it and there is no file.
