This (for now very short) guide explains how to install and configure DownloadDaemon as a developer.
To develop DownloadDaemon (or one of the clients), some special things need to be done, because you probably want
to execute DD as a normal user (for more comfortable debugging and IDE usage).
The best way to develop is by using Qt Creator, since it can handle the CMakeFiles directly.
You can also run CMake with the -g parameter to create project files for your prefered IDE (if supported by CMake).

1: Install DD the regular way (cmake on source tree && make install)
2: modify the configuration files to make them non-root-console firiendly (ie: set log_file to "stdout" and the download folder to something /home/xxs/Downloads or some other writeable directory of your user)
3: chmod -R /etc/downloaddaemon a+rw
4: set the environment-variable "DD_DATA_DIR" to your build directory. I personally prefer to import the Project in QtCreator this way: Start qt-creator, Open src/daemon/CMakeLists.txt in it. When prompted for a build-directory,
I usually use <svn-root>/trunk/build or something like that. When prompted for the CMake flags, use
"-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-g -Wall". Finally, when you run DownloadDaemon in QtCreator for the first time, you are prompted what exactly to run. Chose the DownloadDaemon binary in <svn-root>/trunk/build and at the bottom of the window, you can set the runtime-environment (defaults to "Same as Build-environment"). You have to change that and add the DD_DATA_DIR=./ variable.
